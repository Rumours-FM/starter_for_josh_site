            <h2>GAMES &amp; LEVEL DESIGNER</h2>
            <p class="particle">.... and particle wizard</p>
            <p class="about-text">My  name is Josh Whitkin. I'm a professional with more than 7 years of industry experience in Games Design, Level design, Scripting and Visual Effects.  What makes me passionate about games is the combination of technology  and creativity, and how multiple disciplines come together to create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D platformers or 3D environments.
                I always tell a story.
